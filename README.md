# STL Afro-Latin Dance Calendar
A React + Vite app using FullCalendar to display events from public Google Calendars.

## Features

- Display a Google Calendar in a calendar grid.
- Fetch events from **public Google Calendars** using an API key.
- Fully client-side (no server required).

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18+ recommended)
- npm or yarn
- Google Cloud account to get a **Google Calendar API key**  

## Setup

1. [One-Time Only] **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/my-calendar.git
cd my-calendar
```

2. [One-Time Only] Install dependencies
` npm install `
` npm install firebase `
` npm install @fullcalendar/list `

3. (May be needed) Introduce yourself with GitHub credentials so you can push/pull
- I used VSCode, in which you will also need to run in the terminal:

```bash
git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
```

4. Create API Key from Google then create .env file in project root
  - (yes annoyingly will require getting a trial attached to a payment in case you run over usage)
  - Navigate to Google Cloud Console (https://console.cloud.google.com/) -> APIs and Services -> Library. Search for Google Calendar and enable the API
  - now navigate to Credentails -> API key and generate an API Key
  - Under "API restrictions", select "Restrict key" and check "Google Calendar API".
  - Under "Application restrictions", optionally restrict to websites (e.g., http://localhost:5173/* for local dev). Leave unrestricted for now.
Click "Save".
  - Each dev needs their own API key in .env -- do not share key publicly
  - Note: works only with public Google Calendars until we implement OAuth.
  - In .env file, add the following line, replacing 'YOUR_API_KEY_HERE' with the one you created
`VITE_GOOGLE_CALENDAR_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY_HERE`

5. Run the app 
` npm run dev `

6. View the app running on http://localhost:5173/
  - You should also get a popup to confirm app is running and what port the app is running on. If you don't see a popup, check the terminal in the IDE).
  - You should see a calendar, and if your api key was set correctly, you will see a US Holiday on it's appropriate date pulled from the Google US Public Holidays calendar

7. CTL + C to stop the process, localhost sould show not available.

# Troubleshooting

1. If you see localhost continue to run or not show updates, run
` netstat -ano | findstr :5173 `


2. Use the last column to replace all as '{EACH_PID}' including brackets below, until all are terminated:
` taskkill /PID {EACH_PID} /F `

3. You should see localhost show as unavailable.

# Database Access and Management

- I've decided to use a Firebase Firestore Project, as it's free for small projects (up to 1 GB storage, 50k reads/day), scales well, and integrates easily with React. I have Sanity on the backburner as another free tier option that's more CMS based if it makes sense to use later.
- I am working on a sample Firebase db in my personal space, but will create an official one to use and share with admins.

1. If you have not yet done so from the instructions above, in this project root folder, run
` npm install firebase `

2. You should see a sample event from 1/9 linked to a Firebase event instance
  - Events in calendar view will pull directly from Google Calendar
  - Events in pop-up view (click on one event) will pull from Google Calendar + Firebase

3. To connect a new event with Firebase:
    - a) add the event as a Google Calendar event
    - b) look at the event on the website, when you click on it a popup will give you the eventId (will change to be in console log and just show "details not found")
    - c) in Firebase, create the event details. Include the following:
        - add or locate organizer_id (includes first_name, last_name, facebook_link, instagram_link, website_link)
        - eventId, eventType, flyer_link, organizer, price, primaryKeyName, title, organizer_id, price
    - note: for now, flyer_link is generated with imgur -> right click "Open image in a new tab" -> copy URL


## Other Randomness

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) (or [oxc](https://oxc.rs) when used in [rolldown-vite](https://vite.dev/guide/rolldown)) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## React Compiler

The React Compiler is not enabled on this template because of its impact on dev & build performances. To add it, see [this documentation](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler/installation).

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
